Hey there Michael here and in this video I'm going to 
show my IAT265 program 
The program title is broke college student lunch and
it is a simulation on how to cook instant noodles

Tech 6) for technical requirement 6 this is my intro screen with short instructions
The objects are controlled by the mouse clicking and dragging

Tech 5) for technical requirement 5 I have noises to most of my interactions
Tech 2) show perlin noise, fractals for my technical requirement 2
Tech 3) kitchen background, for technical 3 but its not animated
Tech 4) show button decorator pattern

1) I have 4 packages assets which load my assets, decorator used for decorators
kitchen which holds my kitchen objects and main for starting and controlling the app
2) I have a abstract superclass for the kitchen objects and abstract + interface for my decorator
Code 4) I dont have any objects that use a factory pattern because all my objects are loaded into the panel class
code 5) Kitchen object, for the technical requirement I used an abstract super class with pull up of methods, I didn't include setImg because i loaded the image in the panel
code 6) no code errors except for minim so I did not include any try catch statements


Walkthrough
I just follow the instructions at the bottom
my ECOs are the complex shapes
decorator pattern features
all images are handmade (show asset folder)
I used inkscape to create vectors and sketches

and for the sound i got it from online sources 
here is my reference list
(drag notepad)
